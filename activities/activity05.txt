Features Requiring Mutual Exclusivity for Online food Delivery Platform (Capstone):-
 
1. Order Management Context
Order management is one of the most critical aspects of an online food delivery platform, where mutual exclusivity plays a significant role.
Order Placement:
Reason: When a user places an order, the system needs to ensure that the inventory is updated accurately and the order details are recorded correctly without interference from other concurrent operations.
Example Scenario: Two users ordering the last item of a dish at the same time could lead to one order being unfulfilled if not managed properly.
 
2. Restaurant Management Context
Managing restaurant data, especially menu items and availability, requires careful handling of concurrent access.
Menu Management:
Reason: Updates to the menu, such as price changes or availability, should be handled exclusively to ensure users see accurate and current information.
Example Scenario: If two restaurant managers or admin are updating the same menu item simultaneously, it could result in conflicting information being displayed to users.
Restaurant Profile Updates:
Reason: Changes to the restaurant's profile should be synchronized to maintain data integrity across the platform.
Example Scenario: Simultaneous updates could lead to profile discrepancies, such as location or contact information errors.
 
3. User Management Context
Profile Updates:
Reason: When users update their profiles, such as changing their email address or password, it should be done exclusively to ensure data consistency.
Example Scenario: Concurrent updates (from user or admin) could lead to profile corruption, resulting in users being unable to access their accounts correctly.
 
Not considered Notification (duplicate notification case) and Payment modules (duplicate transaction case) due to limited scope of capstone.
