Case Study: In the capstone, what would be the Docker strategy : 

Deploying the services : <per host> OR <shared host> 

How to use Docker deployment in the Capstone project : Which pattern is best suited for the services in the capstone project



For a real-world production deployment of an online food ordering platform, the per host deployment strategy is generally preferred:

Why Per Host:

Scalability: Services like order processing, user management, and search can have varying demands.
Independent scaling ensures each service can handle its specific load.
Security and Isolation: Enhanced isolation is critical for protecting sensitive data (e.g., payment processing) and minimizing the impact of vulnerabilities.
Service Resilience: Isolating services on separate hosts reduces the risk of a single point of failure affecting multiple services.


Practical Implementation:

Start with critical services like user, search and order on dedicated hosts.
Use shared hosts for non-critical services (e.g., notifications) if needed, to optimize costs while maintaining performance.


In summary, the per host deployment pattern is best suited for a real-world environment, especially for a scalable, secure, and high-traffic online food ordering platform.
